In this example, I show how to do regression analysis on nonlinear data. 
The data is simulating the single-slit diffraction pattern with some added noise.
Compared to the linear-regression model, here I have added an extra hidden layer with RELU activation. See the implementation inside the code. The loss function and the error minization is similar to the case of linear regression.
